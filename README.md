# :mag: Hook Spy

Inspect and debug HTTP requests.

Take send HTTP requests to the link at the top of the page, and receive HTTP headers, body and other info in your browser. Useful for seeing webhook payloads or debugging your http clients.


## Why

I wanted to try out RethinkDB and change feeds. I also wanted to try to play around with websockets in go.

I also found out about this cool service called [Hyper.sh](https://hyper.sh/) recently and wanted to try it out. Everything is hosted there.
